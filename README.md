# code-HW05 Day Planner - Charles Pitek

## About
This is a in browser day planner.

## Use
To use the day planner open it up in your browser.

Once in the planner you will see the header and then below that is a line for each hour of a normal work day.
the left side shows the time, the middle is where you can enter tasks and the right side is a button to save tasks to the planner.

To save a task simply type the task into the text area and click the save button. once tasks have been saved the hours will color code to grey if passes, red for current, and green for upcoming. When saving tasks do not use any commas (","). This will cause everything after the comma to populate an hour later.

The planner will clear on a new day.
